title: "Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Justicd"
---

Diversity, equity, inclusion and justice are critical to progress not only in social and earth system research, but also in implementing the necessary policies to address climate and air quality in an equitable manner. I work to incorporate these topics into my research approach, where I focus on [three main aspects of justice](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589811619300059): Intergenerational, Intersectional, and International. Beyond this, I work to improve the diversity, equity, and inclusion of the earth sciences through research, leading courses, running programs, and acting as a student representative on committees. I also firmly believe that the scientific process, particularly that regarding climate and pollution, should explicitly involve community members.


## Co-Author of Research on Gender Equity
One of my interests is providing data driven research on JEDI in the geosciences. This work can be found in my publications tab.

## Scientist for AGU's Thriving Earth Exchange
As a scientist for the [American Geophysical Union's Thriving Earth Exchange](https://thrivingearthexchange.org/), I have the opportunity to work with a community group based in Ohio, where they are monitoring and quantifying the impacts of fracking on the air quality in the region. My contributions to work with this group are guided by the community group, "[Concerned Ohio River Residents] (https://www.concernedohioriverresidents.org/)". I encourage anyone interested in the program to check out open projects that you can volunteer for, and feel free to reach out with any questions!

## Co-Coordinator of Application Mentorship Program
I have served as the co-coordinator for our [application mentorship program](https://sites.google.com/view/eaps-student-advisory-council/application-assistance), which aims to provide support for graduate applicants who may not have access to the mentorship they need in applying to graduate school. I coordinate the assignment of mentors, training of mentors, and evaluation of the program. 

## Co-Creator, Reading Course on Racism, Colonialism, and Extraction in the Geosciences
I co-lead a [course](http://tide.scripts.mit.edu/home/reading-series/) in our department on the historical and social context of the geosciences. This course is run as a participatory seminar where we discuss relevant work on philosophies and methodologies of science, the geosciences in relation to extractivism and colonialism, and environmental justice and racism.

## Student Representative on EAPS DEI-Committee 
I have acted as one of two student representatives on our [DEI-Committee](https://eapsweb.mit.edu/about/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-committee). As a student representative, I collaborate with faculty, staff, researchers and students on and off the committee to set priorities, develop action plans, and implement them. My personal focus has been advocating for and serving on the hiring committee for a DEI-Officer, serving as an intermediary between the student body and the committee, and working to collect data on DEI relevant issues in our department on an annual basis.
