title: "Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion"
---

**Justice, equity, diversity and inclusion are critical to progress not only in social and earth system research, but also in implementing the necessary policies to address climate and air quality in an equitable manner. I work to incorporate these topics into my research approach, where I focus on three main aspects of justice: Intergenerational, Intersectional, and International (Burch et. al, 2019 10.1016/j.esg.2019.100006). Beyond this, I work to improve the diversity, equity, and inclusion of the earth sciences through research, leading courses, running programs, and acting as a student representative on committees.**
