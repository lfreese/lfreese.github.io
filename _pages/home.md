I am a PhD candidate in Atmospheric Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, working with Noelle Selin, with an educational background in atmospheric chemistry, climate physics, and environmental policy.

I research the intersection of **social and earth systems, at local and global scales**, bringing together *atmospheric chemistry*, *energy systems*, *climate*, *justice*, *health* and *policy*. I am passionate about **policy-oriented work**, **community-based science**, and applications of **systems modeling to ensure justice in the energy transition**. 

Prior to starting my PhD, I worked at the Rock Energy and Environment institute in Beijing, China where I studied the inequities of the energy transition, and collaborated with the Indian government on shared goals between China and India for pollution management. I also worked with Green Camel Bell in Lanzhou, China on community science projects. Most recently, I worked at the Wilson Center's China Environment Forum in Washington, D.C., where I did research on U.S.-Chinese collaboration on environmental policy, and helped spearhead a community science collaboration between the two countries. I graduated with a B.Sc. in Science, Technology and International Affairs from Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service. I am also a potter throwing out of MIT's SAA studio, and I spend my free time rowing and running local rivers and trails.
