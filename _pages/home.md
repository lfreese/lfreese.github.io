I am a PhD candidate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, working with Noelle Selin.

I research the intersection of **social and earth systems, at local and global scales**, bringing together atmospheric chemistry, energy systems, climate, policy and community science. I am passionate about **community-based science**, **policy-oriented work**, and applications of **systems modeling to solve important sustainability issues of the energy transition**.

Prior to starting my PhD, I worked at the Rock Energy and Environment institute in Beijing, China where I studied the inequities of the energy transition, and collaborated with the Indian government on shared goals between China and India for pollution management. I also worked with Green Camel Bell in Lanzhou, China on community science projects. Most recently, I worked at the Wilson Center's China Environment Forum in Washington, D.C., where I did research on U.S.-Chinese collaboration on environmental policy, and helped spearhead a community science collaboration between the two countries. I graduated with a B.Sc. in Science, Technology and International Affairs from Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, and spend my free time throwing pottery, running trails, and rowing along the nearest body of water I can find.
