I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford where I research the fundamentals, impacts, and mitigation of climate change and air pollution. I work in the [Climate-Energy Lab](https://climate-energy.org/) with Ken Caldeira. I obtained my PhD in Atmospheric Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with an educational background in atmospheric chemistry, climate physics, and environmental policy.

I research the intersection of **social and earth systems, at local and global scales**, bringing together *atmospheric chemistry*, *climate physics*, *energy systems*, and *human impacts*. I am passionate about **policy-oriented work**, **community-based science**, and applications of **systems modeling to ensure a just transition**, while also working to improve our understanding of the **fundamentals of earth science**. I am excited by just how much the applied and fundamental earth sciences can be used together! 

Previously, I worked at the Rock Energy and Environment institute in Beijing, China where I studied the inequities of the energy transition in coal regions in Northeastern China, and collaborated with the Indian government on shared goals between China and India for pollution management. I also worked with Green Camel Bell in Lanzhou, China on community science projects to remediate desertification. Following this, I worked at the Wilson Center's China Environment Forum in Washington, D.C., where I did research on U.S.-Chinese collaboration on environmental policy, and helped spearhead a community science collaboration between the two countries. I graduated with a B.Sc. in Science, Technology and International Affairs from Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service. I am also a potter, and I spend my free time rowing local waterways, and hiking/running nearby trails with my partner.
