I am a PhD student researching the intersection of atmospheric chemistry, energy systems, climate, and policy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I work with Noelle Selin in the Department of Earth, Atmosphere and Planetary Sciences. My research aims to understand the influence climate has on historical and future air quality, the impacts that humans have had on the chemical composition of the atmosphere, and what policies and energy decisions are best for mitigating climate change and air pollution. Prior to starting my PhD, I worked at the Rock Energy and Environment institute in Beijing, China; for Green Camel Bell in Lanzhou, China; and for the Wilson Center's China Environment Forum in Washington, D.C. I graduated with a B.Sc. in Science, Technology and International Affairs from Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service. If you are interested in any of these topics, please feel free to get in touch!
